			Required fields are marked with a red asterisk. Field data types are noted next to the input fields. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			Fields that accept HTML input may be "previewed" in view mode, but note that <em>styles do not necessarily match the application style sheet</em>.  
			To author valid HTML data, look for a free HTML editor online.  Enter
			trademarks and other symbols using HTML codes. <em>Note that carriage returns and line feeds
			do not work in HTML, and you must not enter them in your data or you may break the web application scripts</em>.  
		</p>
		<p>	
			<em>DO NOT COPY AND PASTE CONTENT FROM MICROSOFT WORD OR EXCEL.</em>  
			If you have content in Microsoft, copy and paste into a simple text editor (NOTEPAD) and makes sure all
			hidden or extraneous characters are removed before adding it to your database.
